Query: What are the key findings on proposed GNN-Ret? 

Answer: The key findings on the proposed GNN-Ret method show that it effectively enhances retrieval for QA by exploiting the relatedness between passages, 
outperforming baselines such as SBERT by improving retrieval coverage of supporting passages. According to the experiments, GNN-Ret demonstrates its superiority 
on various benchmark datasets, including the Quality dataset, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the context of an entire story (Section 3.2)
